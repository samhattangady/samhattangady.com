                    I try to pursue any and all projects that pique my interest. I believe that the greatest way to improve and expand my skillset
                    is to consistently work on various side-projects. Most of these end up abandoned at the proof-of-concept stage, but by then,
                    they have already served their purpose.

                    Hey. I'm Sam.
                    <br></br>
                    I would like to enable people to do more. I believe that a good set of tools is fundamental for anyone to be fully productive. In my experience,
                    I have seen that it is often difficult to recognise the oppurtunities that are ideal for tooling and automation. I would love to build a career
                    around building tools that help people.
                    <br></br>
                    I have always loved building things. I thought that becoming a mechanical engineer would help me pursue that, however, it turned out that it was not a career
                    for me. Somewhere along the way, I discovered programming. It checked a lot of boxes for me. I have always found the act of writing
                    code to be engaging. It is the perfect mix of logic and creativity, and when used well, a force multiplier for human effort.
                    <br></br>
                    I don't really have much more to say. I am just writing this paragraph to make sure the content in all three tabs is atleast somewhat equal. So
                    here is a little more. I feel that front-benchers need to have atleast as much pride as the back-benchers, early mornings are far more productive than
                    late nights and that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens may be the only thing that can change the world.

                    As one of the first developers at Skylark Drones, I was fortunate enough to be faced with the widest possible range of problems that needed to be solved. Over my tenure at Skylark, I worked on a wide variety of internal and external tools and solutions like;
                    <ul class='is-size-7'>
                      <li>
                        - An automated data pipeline running on the cloud, that took drone images, ran several processing operations, and prepared the output to be ready for viewing on the web.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        - Several web-based POCs that showcased the different use cases of data captured by drone. This included projects involving videos, maps, and 3D models.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        - A data uploader that automatically uploaded data from on-field whenever network connectivity was available.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        - Internal tools to segregate data based on various parameters.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        - Internal hiring tools to streamline our hiring process, with automated mail parsing linked to our Trello hiring board.
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                    As a first working experience after completing my Mechanical Engineering, EpZeta gave me a great platform to learn. As a part of the 2 developer team, I got to really test my self-learned skills as a developer, and the experience was great.

                    My role was to integrate the existing machine-learning and data-science models into a usable web backend that would function as the companies proof of concept. Over the course of that I also managed to work on a bit more;
                    <ul class='is-size-7'>
                      <li>
                        - Developed proof of concept for a recommender system service.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        - Was in charge of backend web development including implementation of ReST services and hosting.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        - Employed various machine learning techniques, including natural language processing (tfidf, lda) and genetic algorithms.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        - Created several data visualizations to aid in the development process.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
